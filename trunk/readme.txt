== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need a Constant Contact account? =
Yes, this plugin requires a <a href="http://wordpress.constantcontact.com/features/signup.jsp" title="Sign up for Constant Contact" rel="nofollow">Constant Contact account</a>.

= Where is the settings page =

In the WordPress administration, navigate to Contact > Constant Contact in the WordPress sidebar. The URL should be `[yoursite.com]/wp-admin/admin.php?page=ctct_cf7`

= How do I change the name of the lists displayed to users? =

When inserting the Constant Contact List code into your form, you will see code that may look something like this:

`
[ctct ctct-563 type:checkboxes 'General Newsletter::#1' 'Another List::#40']
`

Let's look at the part of the code that is `'General Newsletter::#1'`. That part tells the plugin to create an option with the name `General Newsletter` with a List ID of `1`. `'Another List::#40'` creates another option with the name `Another List` and the List ID is `40`. To modify the name of the list, change the part before `::`. You could then rename "General Newsletter" to "Product Information" by changing the code to `'Product Information::#1'`

= This plugin uses PressTrends =
By installing this plugin, you agree to allow gathering anonymous usage stats through PressTrends. The data gathered is the active Theme name, WordPress version, plugins installed, and other metrics. This allows the developer of this plugin to know what compatibility issues to test for.

To remove PressTrends integration, add the code to your theme's functions.php file:

`
add_action('plugins_loaded', 'remove_CTCTCF7_presstrends_plugin', 20);
function remove_CTCTCF7_presstrends_plugin() {
	remove_action('admin_init', array('CTCTCF7', 'presstrends_plugin'));
}
`
